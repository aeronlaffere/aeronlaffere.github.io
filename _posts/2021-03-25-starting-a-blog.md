I decided to start writing a blog. I do have quite a few other things to do so this decision might not appear strictly rational, but since this blog is partly motivated by a desire to make my thoughts explicit more often I will start by explaining why I'm doing it.

Making writing part of your personal identity is an important step to writing effectively. Writing for an audience or many audiences at the same time, even better. I am doing this to expand the ways I translate thoughts and experiences into meaningful text for consumption by others. Hopefully it is useful for you in some small way as it is for me. 

At the same time I am trying out reading in public with a Notion notebook of thoughts on papers I read. That space is meant to be transient and evolving, a digital garden of sorts, whereas here I am hoping to do something more traditional with the blog format. Updates here will be infrequent and irregular.
